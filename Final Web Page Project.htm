            <h1>How to Travel Internationally for Super Cheap!</h1>
            <p>The luxury of being able to go throughout Europe and Asia for long periods of time is just
            a dream for many of us but I am here to tell you how to do it cheaply and effectively. With meticulous
            planning, cost conscious travelers such as yourself can enjoy the history and beauty of many cities
            all over the world at a fraction of the price. Although backpackers on a limited budget may have to
            sacrifice some of the nicer amenities, they can gain invaluable experiences by going to cultural and
            not tourist attractions.</p>
            <h3>Checklist for your trip</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Sturdy backpack for easy movement between destinations</li>
              <li>Hostle reservations</li>
              <li>Flight reservations</li>
              <li>Currency for the countries you will be visiting</li>
              <li>Most importantly a plan of where you will be going and what you will see</li>

      <h2>The 2 Easiest Ways to Save Money</h2>
      <h3>1. Plane Flights</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest and best way to save money when starting your travels is choosing the best and
      cheapest plane flight for your trip. There are hundreds of different airlines and websites that show
      rapidly changing and varying prices across all websites. Many websites such as <a href="https://www.priceine.com/"> Priceline </a>
      and <a href="https://www.momondo.com/"> Momondo </a> offer great deals on flights all over the world but
      sometimes are misleading in the prices they quote you as well as how many stops the flights have which
      from personal experience can cause major problems. One of the websites that I like to use the most is
      <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/"> Google Flights </a> because it is a very easy-to-use interface
      that allows me to compare specific travel days with the prices of them so I know that I am finding the
      absolute best prices. You can also use many different types of filters on many of these websites if you
      prefer to fly with a specific airline or you want to fly nonstop flights only.</p>
      <p>Another great tip is to be flexible on the days that you choose to travel, if you are flexible on the
        days as well as the months even that you travel then you will have a much easier time finding those flights
        that are super cheap and exactly what you're looking for.</p>

        be based on different dates</h4>

      <h3>2. Accommodation</h3>
      <p>The other easiest and most important way to save money when you are traveling is to search and find
        hostles and other cheap hotels in order to maximize the amount of money you save when you are abroad.
        There are a plethora if different options to choose from including <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/"> Couch Surfing </a>
        and <a href="https://www.hihostels.com/"> Hostels International </a> that have hostels... and couches for
        you to sleep on all over the world. Generally though during peak season many hostles get reserved long
        before your trip so I recommend that you book far in advance, usually <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">2-3 months</span> if you have that much
        time to plan. With proper planning and excecution you too can learn to travel extremely cheaply and
        be able to book hostels for less than <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">$15</span> per night at times. </p>

      <div id="FAQs" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
          <h3>How do I find cheap transportation within the cities I visit?</h3>
          <p>In almost all of the cities you will visit in your time abroad will have a lot of different
            options for transportation including busses and trains as well as the in-city metro where you
            can almost always purchase passes for less than <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">10</span> euros per day which will allow you to go
            all round the city for that price. If there is no mass transportation provided than you can
            access then you should be able to rent bicycles on the street for a similar price for the entire day.</p>
          <h3>How can I make sure I am getting the best plane ticket price?</h3>
          <p>Well, that is a difficult question because the answer is that you can never really be 100% sure that
            you are getting the absolute best price for the plane ticket that you get. As I said in the Planes and
            Accommodation tab though, there are ways to ensure that the price that you get is on the low end.
            For domestic flights its best to book <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">57</span> days in advance and for flights to Europe for example
            studies have shown that the best time to buy them is about <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">120</span> days in advance.</p>
          <h3>When is the absolute cheapest part of the year to travel?</h3>
          <p>There really is no magic dates that flights will be cheapest at any point during the year but
            I will say that <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">October and September</span> are very cheap travel times as well as flights that leave
            and or return on <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Tuesdays and Wednesdays</span>, as well as flights that leave and or return on days
            that the country of origin has a major holiday.</p>
